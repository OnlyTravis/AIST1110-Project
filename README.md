# Group Project for AIST1110

# To-do list : 
- Bonus points based on word length (to balance out the game) 
    -> how about assigning points to each letter like in Scrabble?
    -> maybe if I have time after finishing this I still need to make the ai for singleplayer
- End Screen

# Possible Ideas
- Special Letters (reduces/increases conveyor speed of your opponent, bonus points, reduces timer)
- Table to store letters
